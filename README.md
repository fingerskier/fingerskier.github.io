## Playable Resume

The `/app` directory holds a small React application that renders a sideâ€‘scrolling resume.
Install dependencies and start the dev server with:

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between sections. Update `app/src/resume.json` with your own information to populate the game.
