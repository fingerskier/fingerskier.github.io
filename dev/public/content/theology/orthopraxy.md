# Orthopraxy

  Orthopraxy means normal practice- those actions and practices which are common amongst all Christians.

**James 1:27** Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.

  This verse beautifully captures the cultic foundation, or system of religious practices, which make up the identity of a group of Christians.
In the Christian Church, as a whole, it is the seminal practices which are particular to loyal believers in Christ and Yahweh.
There are many practices among various traditions of Christianity, but there are some which are common to all.


## Pragma

Directives for the practice of the faith.

**Acts 2:42** And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

  Teaching is the first, and most public, of the four directives.
This is Biblical direction from the Apostles given by those with the gift of teaching.
Those teachings are applicable to the hearer and grounded in the stories and lessons of the Bible.

  Fellowship is the purposeful gathering of believers.
These gatherings of believers are characterized by Bible study, prayer, and sacraments.
This directive is a more intimate affair than that of teaching.

  Food denotes meals shared by believers; again, more intimate than fellowship.
Eating and drinking often cause a relaxation allowing deeper, more natural communion with one another.

  Prayer is the most intimate of the directives.
It is speaking to God in the midst of others.
Prayers can be a declaration, a request, or a lament.

**2 Timothy 4:2,13** Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.

  Preaching is a public exhortation of the stories and truths of the Bible.
It consists of a gospel message couched in terms that are applicable to the hearers and their circumstances.

  Reproof is a public correction of the hearer.
It is an exposition of some particular sin and a call to some act of repentance.

  Rebuking is a more severe criticism of some sinful act.
It is meant to deter the hearer from continuing along that path.

  Exhortation is encouraging, instructive motivation.
It incorporates elements of warning and then comfort and consolation.


## Mission

The primary focus of action given to the Church by Christ.

**Matthew 28:18-20** And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

**Acts 1:8** But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.


  The mission of the Church is to make disciples of all nations.
A disciple is someone who is disciplined to follow the common, personal practices of a follower of Christ.
These include prayer, Bible study, fellowship, and engaging in the sacraments.
Making disciples means to deliberately engage new believers in how to cultivate and then grow a personal relationship with God.
All nations refers to every people group on the planet.
Though it may be interesting to identify and catalog these various groups it is not necessary:
we must simply be constantly seeking out and engaging demographics which needs to hear the gospel and present it to them.


## Tertiarae

  The tertiary, or personally preferred, practices of the faith.
These are Biblically based practices which are not common to all believers.
The scriptural basis for these beliefs are not as clear as the more foundational, dogma.

**1 Corinthians 3:16** Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?

**1 Peter 2:5** you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

**1 Corinthians 6:19** Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own

**1 Corinthians 12:12-27** For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit. For the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.

  It is, in fact, these the very nature of the temple that each stone is allowed distinctive size and shape which fits it into place.
Though such distinctives often characterize denominations or sects of Christianity, it is not necessary for them to be devisive.
Distinctive need not imply division.
Denominationalism and congregationalism are natural because of nationalism and ethnicity.
Such beliefs may very well add a wholesome flavor to the faith which makes the Church better able to reach more people.


## Conclusion

  An understanding of common practices within the Church is important for the believer.
It helps to understand the methods by which we can have a more fulfilling life in Christ.
It also helps us to distill what is most important to us as individuals and the Church as a whole.
