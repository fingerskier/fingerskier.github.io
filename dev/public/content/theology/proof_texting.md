# Proof Texting

`The art of making the Bible say what you want it to say.`

An alternative, 50-cent, word is: *eisegesis*;
which is `the art of making the Bible say what you want it to say...but with multi-syllabic, utterative, emmanations.`.


## Unicycling

  The other day I was stuck on top of my 7-foot unicycle, sucking on a pumpkin lollipop.
I didn't know how to dismount without falling on my face.
Luckily I had my phone so I searched for an answer to my predicament and, lo and behold, the exact solution was presented:

Amazing, the exact answer I was looking for!

  This is, of course, completely contrived- I have no .
However, it illustrates a psychological phenomenon that often manifests in our theology.


## Reading Out

  Most Christian believers, and even many non-believers, approach sacred texts with some expectation of supernatural quality.
This is not unfounded: there are myriad occasions where the Bible has proved itself to be of supernatural origin despire being authored by humans.
The reason for the same supernatural agent touched the lives of all those humans who authored the Biblical texts.

  But we do ourselves, and our mates, a disservice when we approach the Bible looking for a particular answer _and_ we import our assumptions and presumptions.
We further that disservice by ignoring, or diminishing, the mindset and circumstances of the original author(s).
It correct to say that the Bible is historically and scientifically accurate.
It is another thing entirely, and entirely incorrect, to say that it is a science or history book.
It is neither, it is a theology book.
The vast majority of it's content deals with God's plan of redemption for humanity [and the rest of creation].

  A good illustration of this is the story of Matthew Fontaine Maury.
He was intrigued by the "paths of the seas" mentioned in Psalm 8:8.
As an American naval officer and oceanographer he was able to systematically map out oceanic currents.
He was inspired to do so by the Bible but it was Providence that gave him the training and opportunity.
To the ancient-near-east author the "paths of seas" were not oceanic currents caused by pockets of warm and cold water.
They were routes forged by the gods- sometimes the trip took months, sometimes weeks, at the whim of whichever god.
The Biblical phrase is accurate but not prescriptive, it took millenia of human advancement to understand the full breadth of it- and neither interpretation is invalid.

  Commander Maury did not specifically approach scripture with the intent to ferret out scientific knowledge.
His curiosity, training, and belief in scriptural veracity led him to discover.


## Eisegesis

  Our propensity to stretch the scripture to meet our supernatural, sociological expectations has led to many errors and conflicts.
This comes in two flavors: modern contextualization and frequency illusion.

### Modern Contextualization

  This is the practice of reading a scripture and interpreting it according to what "we" know right now.
Its important to say "we" from the pulpit to dampen our self-absorption.
Reading a single passage of scripture in English and deriving its meaning directly is invalid.
Thankfully, the Church has had scores of teachers and scholars over the centuries who were able to convey Bibilical truths [from the entirety of scripture] which tempers our interpretations.
However, we often disregard who the original audience was in doing so.
We read passages about the roles of women and men and completely miss the application in the day-to-day lives of the original hearers.
We read passages about cultic practices and assume we should apply them to our lives while the original message was how to reconcile with God **in spite of** those practices.

### Frequency Illusion

  Many believers have had the experience where they were seeking a revelation and read a random passage of scripture that directly applied to their circumstance.
This may well be a supernatural event but it does not codify our interpretation.
It is, in fact, a property of nature that fundamental truths bubble to the surface of human-muddied ponds of thinking.
It is partly a psychological phenomenon: if you deeply desire a red car then you start seeing red cars everywhere.
They didn't appear through magic, you just started noticing what was already there.
This doesn't mean they weren't as real before but, rather, that we have limited perception and, at times, Providence shifts and orchestrates reality to our benefit.


## Exegesis

  It should be the case that, more and more, with age, we approach God with a humility to hear.
All believers make requests of God but not all believers listen for His response.
Too often we misconstrue whatever poofs into our mind as an answer from heaven.
I cannot say that this is never the case, but we cannot assume that it is always the case, and we cannot ever act on it without validating against scripture.
I plan to do a full article on exegesis with a guide but suffice it say that scripture was written for us but it was not written to us.

  If you truly believe that God is omnipotent then it well within His power to craft a message that is applicable throughout the ages.
However, that not preclude Him from using it's original historical context the illucidate the message.
Consequently, we have no basis with which to assume that our interpretation is valid.
Further, we cannot assume that a good interpretation cannot be improved, or subsumed, by a better one.


## Conclusion

  Physics and biology are always discovering finer, more elegantly complex truths about the universe.
We have every reason to assume that theology is the same.
Saint Jerome said, "The Scriptures are shallow enough for a babe to come and drink without fear of drowning and deep enough for theologians to swim in without ever touching the bottom."
It takes centuries for the Church to iron out difficult dogmatic issues in scripture.
We cannot assume ourselves to have some purer powers of arbitration.
Ten years from now you will not be the person you are today.
May your theology be one decade sharper and yourself one decade more theonized.
